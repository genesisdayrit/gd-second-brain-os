## Name the Idea:

**Step 1: Find one idea that resonates with you. (Off the cuff, from experience, no research) (2 mins)**

1. 

**Step 2: Gather five ideas that relate to your first idea. (From memory, your ideal database, or 5-min brain dump. The goal is to build on your main idea, suspend judgement and write everything that comes up) (5 mins)**

1. 

**Step 3: Progressively summarize your ideas (Do 2 quick scans on what you’ve written, bold key ideas & phrases, and highlight from the bolded selection) (2 mins)**

- [ ]  Bold
- [ ]  Highlight

**Step 4: Put your ideas in a sequence that makes sense (Arrange your ideas in a logical sequence. First you get everything on the page. Next, you rearrange them to make sense of them. Juggle points around to build a logical sequence)(5 mins)**

- [ ]  Rearrange Ideas

**Step 5: Supplement your outline (5 mins). Add more points to make it “POP”  (5 mins)**

**Step 6: Create a map of your emerging piece. (5-10 bullet outline. Build narrative flow. Think of transition points. Pro tip: use but, therefore for your transitions as much as you can)**

- [ ]  Outline
    - Story
    - Observation
    - CTA

**Step 7: Write a “Blurry Thumbnail.” It’s a 200 word high-level view of your piece. Use [Otter.ai](http://Otter.ai) or other audio recording device to get this done fast. Record yourself. Use the transcript as base. Clean it up to build your summary. (15 mins) (Optional - get feedback)**

This helps you stay on track when publishing the first draft. 

**Step 8: Write your shitty first draft (This should be easy at this point. Remember, don’t edit just yet, this is quick first draft)**

- [ ]  Draft
